Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

1.1 Is Unique: implement and algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structure?

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string. 
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith       ", 13
Output:  "Mr%20John%20Smith"
